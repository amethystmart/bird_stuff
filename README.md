# bird_stuff
 Hi! Here is my autoscraping website on rare bird sightings in NYC.
 This was my first time making a website without a CMS, much less an autoscraping one. 
 This one I did for my class with Jonathan Soma, where we learned coding in around 8 weeks
 in winter 2024. I survived! And I'm here to tell the story. 
 I wanted to do an autoscraping website for my final project because I do think that
 autoscraping is something that can be really really great for journo purposes. 
 Rare birds are cool too, and I am living in NYC atm, so sure why not. 
 Really, the main thing I would change about this project is that I wish I could've made it more beautiful. But no fretting-- we will be learning it next semester, spring 2025, which starts in about a week from now (on my birthday, I should specify.)
